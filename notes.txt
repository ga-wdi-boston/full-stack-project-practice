I'll be making a tabletop make creator. It's a grid that you can fill with things
like trees, monsters, and buildings. This is designed to help the person who is
planning the adventure (dungeon master) create and plan the maps the players
will be using.

I want the user to be able to save their maps and edit them later. To delete
maps they don't want anymore. To name their maps. And to see a list of all the
maps they've created.

In addition to the default user table, I'll be making a Maps table, with a
One-to-Many relationship with the user to hold all of the information about the
user's maps. It will have four columns:
  id (serial primary key)
  map_name (string)
  grid(array)
  user_id(reference id)

I'll be using all of the standard routes for both user and maps.
  Post, Patch, Index, Show, Delete

At this time I do not play to use any third party APIs.

*show wireframe*

And finally this is my time table:
Create the wireframe.
  Start off with a grid of 5x5, go to 10x10 eventually.
Create the database using rails
  Make a user(rails makes this)
  Make a maps table
Create ajax for user
Create logic for clicking on the grid
Create ajax for maps
Include graphics for grid (trees, rocks, grass)
Clean up code and make pretty

Bonus:
Search for other people's maps
Rate other people's maps
Include a dropdown selector for types for terrain
  -grass
  -sand
  -cave
  -buildings
  -monsters
Convert to a pdf so that you can print it.
  (maybe you don't have to convert to pdf to make it printable.)
Variable map sizes
  Independently variable lengths and widths
Generate a random map
