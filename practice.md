## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

My project Idea is a elimination diet tracker. I came up with this becuase my girlfriend is currently trying to figure out what she is allergic to by eliminating one food group every week and documenting how shes feels each day. She would love this kind of app
