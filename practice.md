# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?
  My project idea is to build a site that helps parents/anyone find helpful
  autism-related resources based on where they live, and type of resource they're
  looking for
  (i.e. schools, activities, social security / govt resources, age group)

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

As a user, I want to be able to sign up, sign-in, change password and sign out.
As a user, I want to be able to search autism resources / websites.
As a user, I want to be able to build  "Favorite Resources" and save them.
As a user, I want to be able to add a new resource.
As a user, I want to be able to search for resources by category.
As a user, I want to be able to search for resources by city.


## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

-Location (town, state, zipcode)
-Web sites (url, organization name, category, age group, city id number


## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

helps to go in with a plan.
Break it into 10-day process.
2 day buffer at end.
8 days:
Build API,
