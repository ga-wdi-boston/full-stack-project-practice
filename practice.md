# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

My project idea is a recipie site to store the ingredients you currently have,
and have recipies suggested for you. It is something I have personally wanted for
a while because I often can't think of everything I could make. Anyone who likes
cooking and organization could use it.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

As a user, I would like to log in securely and create an account.
As a user, I would like to store my ingredients.
As a user, I would like to be suggested recipes based on my ingredients.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

Each user will be a table of ingredients.
There will be table of recipes for ingredients.
There will be a table with ingredients for recipes.

The columns will be such as Name of ingredient | quantity | date purchased | recipe name

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

My user, recipie and ingredients table will be connected by many to many, but the
simplest form of that, just sharing a single column key with each other.

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

Create/Patch/Post/Delete

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

No. Possibly a recipe API for additional recipes, but the plan is no 3rd party APIs.

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
