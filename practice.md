# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

MADE A PRESENTATION IN PHOTOSHOP!! Not sure how to link it but ask me whatever -- I'm good to go!


## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
