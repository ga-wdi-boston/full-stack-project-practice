# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

In the city I grew up in it can be trick to find bars and restaurants that are
non-smoking. My project idea is to use google maps API to map out all the
smoke free restaurants so that non-smokers, and smokers too, can find smoke free
restaurants with a nice atmosphere.


## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

I am a user and I want to:
||  find smoke free restaurants.
    ||  bars.
||  add a restaurants or bars to the map.
||  add ratings (how clean the air inside is generally)

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

table: Bar_Restaurants
ID, Name, Type, Location, Address, Phone, Rating, Reviews, Review_ID

table: Users
ID, Name, UserName, Ratings Given, Reviews Given, Reputation

table: Ratings
ID, Score

table: Reviews
ID, Text


## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
