# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

Explanation of project: This application’s purpose is to provide a means of organization to the user. As per the title suggests: it is to help keep one on track in their day to day life. This will be achieved via user input and interaction with the app. A user will be able to monitor their day to tasks and use an interactive ‘reminders’ checklist to ensure they ‘did not forget’ a desired activity or action. Users will be able to manipulate the data that they input as desired tasks and to acquire data about previously completed tasks or tasks that have not yet been completed.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account. As a user, I want to be able to log into my account. As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account. As a user, I want to be able to change my password. As a user I want to be able to be able to see the amount of completed tasks. As a user, I want to be able to input a task to the checklist. As a user, I want to be able to complete that task. As a user, I want to be able to uncheck a task. As a user, I want to be able to delete a task. As a user, I want to be able to modify a task.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

I have a basic out-lay out on my use of comlumns and tables. A rough sketch can be seen in the wirefrmes, below.

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

--Still working on this: updates to come.

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

-- I am still eveluating this issue and will be able to better answer this once some of the logic has ben put into perspective and and i am in a better position to map out these steps.

## 3rd Party APIs

I do not plan to use any 3rd party apps on my first attempt.

## Timetable

 My goal is to be as efficient as possible and break things down it to bit size peices.I have already begun working on the basics, such as api template, browser template and my project goal is wrtten out and organized. I will be tackling the most straightforward task first, so that I can focus the bulk of my time on more comprehensive logic to fulfil the requirements,
