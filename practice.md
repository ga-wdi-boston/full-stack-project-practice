# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

Idea one.
I want to make an app that compares items I have in my "pantry" to items I need from a list of recipes. For instance, if I want to make red beans and rice, and my pantry list says I have onions, celery, bell pepper, beans, rice, and sausage and my red beans recipe says I need all of those ingredients, plus hamhock, Tabasco, and bay leaves my app will tell me I need to get those three extra ingredients. This app could get complicated but I'll keep it simple at first by making the recipes list a short "favorites" recipe list.  I came up with this because I like to cook, already have the recipes in my head, and hate when I forget what I have while grocery shopping.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

As a user, I want to be able to visit my website and add a list of ingredients I have at my house.

As a user I want to be able to pick from a selection of recipes (favorites) and know what I need to get at the store .

As a user I want to be able to add a favorite recipe.
## Plan your tables and columns

I'll need a recipes table and an ingredients table.
Recipes will have a name for the recipes column and a colum with a hash for
ingredients (this may not work)
## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

Not sure just yet, I need to figure out the relationships.

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
