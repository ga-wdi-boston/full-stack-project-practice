# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

```
My project idea is a workout tracker.  Users can log in, enter details of a workout that they did, and see a history of their workouts.

I came up with the idea because I stick to a regular workout schedule, and an app like this would be helpful to me.

I think that this project idea is potentially expandable for the capstone project.  One idea that I have for later is to incorporate a meal/nutrition tracker into the site.
```

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

```
1. As a user, I want be able to create an account with a password so that I can sign in and sign out of app.
2. As a user, I want to be able to enter the details of a workout so that I can have a record of it.
3. As a user, I want to be able to see a history of my workouts so that I can track my progress over time.
```

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

```
- A user table with the following columns: id, given_name, family_name
- A workout table with the following columns: date, exercises
```

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

```
User table (one) --> Workout table (many)

## Routing

```

Two routes:
-user/id
-workout/id

``

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

```
No, I don not plan on using an 3rd party API.
```

## Wireframes

```
I created my wireframes in PowerPoint.  I don't know how to insert them into this file, but will attach them to to the repo and show them when I present tomorrow.
```

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

```
Design: 1 day
Front end: 2 days
Back end: 2 days

```
