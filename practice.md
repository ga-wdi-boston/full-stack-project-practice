## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?
Organize your learning resources (Youtube videos, articles)
I came up with this idea because I felt overwhelmed with all the links shared and I want to have a way to save them in categories.
New coders, coders of all times will use it.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

As a user I want to login and see three categories under which I can save links of resources I use to learn code.
As a user I want to save a learning resource with a name , url, and have the option to add comments to it and topic name to have an organized list  of resources I use to learn code.
As a user I want to update the resources I have saved,like update url, comment.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?
youtube table
Name | url | type

articles table
Name | url | type

Instructional Websites table
name | url | type

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

Working on it...

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

index	Return a list of all resource instances.	GET	/
