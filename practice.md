# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?
Climbing grade log
I am a rock climber and thought it'd be cool to ba able to keep track of my climbs which would help progressing.
People who would use it are rock climbers.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.
As a user I want be able to sign-up/in/out and change my password securely.
As a user I want to be able to log my climbs, see them, edit or delete them in case i made an error.
As a user I don't want any problems with my actions and want it to be super easy to move around the app.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?
I will need a table called `grades` which will have the columns `id primary key`, `date`, and `grade`.

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).
I will just have one table that the user interacts with to log/see/update/delete climbs.

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?
GET - /posts (index)
GET - /post/:id (show)
POST - /posts (create)
PATCH - /post/:id (update)
DELETE - /post/:id (destroy)

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?
No, because the requirrments are that we build a custom API.
We haven't gone over 3rd party APIs.

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.
Done.

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
Plan during 2/15. Once I know what the plan is (it is actually part of the planning) I will be able to figure out how much time I may dedicate to each part of the project.
