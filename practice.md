# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

Tic Tac Toe that asks the players question everytime the players select a space within the 3x3 grid. If the player fails to answer the question, it will become the other player's turn. If possible, make skill cards to enable more features to game. This came up from taking surveys, questionaires and the project tic tac toe. Anyone whose interest in games and questions would love this.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

The server should be able to provide the user interface with questions whenever the player clicks on a spot.
There should be message displaying everything buttons.
Should be able to look into previous games and acquire the questions and answers.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

Question table for all categories
4 columns in each table with 3 incorrect answer and 1 correct answer

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).
