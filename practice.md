# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

I have had a few ideas floating around that I am considering pursuing. The top
three are a workout tracker, a movie quote database, or something with fantasy
football stats. I tried to think of things that I am interested in and
could easily think of ideas and can be passionate about. I think there is
a use case for each of them, though it would depend on complexity on who
would actually use it. I will decide after discussing with the class. For the
purpose of this practice, I will continue with a basic workout tracker.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

As a user, I want to sign up to a the WorkoutTracker (WT) so I can begin
tracking stats.

As a user, I want to be able to sign in so that I can retrieve previous
stats and log new ones.

As a user, I want to be able to log what type of workout I did and how much.

As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a summary of previous stats so I can
track my progress.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

User table
-UserID
-firstname
-lastname
-email

Workouts
-run
-pushups
-squats
-bike
-walk

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

TBD

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

POST- creates new workout
PATCH- updates total workout reps or time
GET- retrieves previous workouts
DELETE- delete a workout entry

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

Not at this time.

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.
