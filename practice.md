# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea
See Google Slides document for greater detail _ https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QLcsGCrQlU_mLm0MlB6Fzsa7aeij7rbucVwoQ990CA4/edit?usp=sharing
What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?
I am making a jeopardy application.  It allows user to answer jeopardy questions
and track their progress and statistics.  I came up with the idea when I found a large set of JSON-formatted jeopardy questions
while looking for a large dataset to practice some SQL queries on. The application could be used by anyone who enjoys
trivia.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

A user can sign up for an account, log in to an account, change his or her password and sign out.
A user can adjust the difficulty to the questions provided by the api.
A user can filter clues by submitting search queries or select from a list of general topics.
A user can view his or her stats.
A user can view his or her question submission history.
A user can compare his or her statistics with other users and view a leaderboard.



## Plan your tables and columns
Clues, responses, users
What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)
See - PP
These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## Routing
See PP
What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

## 3rd Party APIs
none planned at this time
Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

## Wireframes
See PP
Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Timetable
I hope to get an earlier start on this project.  I plan to work on it a lot during the thanksgiving break.
Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
