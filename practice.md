## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
I'm going to start by planning out my models, controllers and serializers in my notebook before testing them in my app
once I get the backend figured out I'm going to start with the frontend. I'm going to use a lot from the tic tac toe project for the front end javascript and ajax
I want to have everything done by the end of the weekend so that I have a couple days to troubleshoot
I don't want to turn in an incomplete project again
