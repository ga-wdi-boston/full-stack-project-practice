# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## An app that lets Trail runners rate and comment on the trails they ran and will allow other
  runners see the ratings and comments

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

## User #1
I love the outdoors, I love running on trails as apposed to roads.
I wish ther were an application that I could record the places that I ran in the past.

User #2
I am new to trail rinning and I wish there were an app that I could go on to see how
other runners have rated the trails.

User #3
I have been running for a long time and I am interested in seeing what other runners think about my favorite trails and would like to see how they feel about trails that I have not tried yet.


We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?
this is an example:
GET https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/organizations/

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?
 Recreation Information Database (RIDB) Application Programming Interface (API).
 Authentication

The RIDB API uses keys to allow access. Registration is free and your key is available to you immediately upon registration. Register for an API key here.

The RIDB API allows two approaches for authentication with the API key:

In an HTTP header that looks like the following: apikey:thisIsMyKey
In a URL parameter that looks like the following: ?apikey=thisIsMyKey
 You must replace thisIsMyKey with your personal API key found on your RIDB profile page.


## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.
