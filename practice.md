# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

A game app.  My brother-in-laws and my wife have been playing it for years, using just a text
program.  The game is a lot of fun, and would benefit from having its own app.  Anyone that is a fan of almost any tv show could use it to create their own game.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

1: As a user, I'd like to keep track of my images
2: As a user, I'd like to compete against others
3: As a user, I'd like to adapt this game to whatever tv show I want

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

Username, group id (can be in multiple groups), images (how do i link images to a database?)

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

USER  >------<  groups

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

Usernames, passwords, groups

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

I don't know....

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

Work in Progress

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

In presentation - I'll break it down though,
first week, wireframe the hell out of it, step by step it out,
second week, write it out!
third week - pretty it up
