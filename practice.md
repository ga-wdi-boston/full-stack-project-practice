# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea
Challenging to schedule meetings when participants are across multiple time zones.
Outlook and other meeting applications do not always provide a user friendly solution.
Provide a light-weight visual tool to compare multiple time zones to identify time slots within business working hours.

## Write between 3-5 user stories
As a user, I want to be compare time zones so that I can find a suitable meeting time across participants.
As a user, I want to keep track of my settings so that I don't need to change them each time.
As a user, I want to be able to create an account with my email and a password so that I can securely use the application.

Full list of user stories and technical tasks are on Trello.
