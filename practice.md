# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?
Shelter/Vet website
database links to pet-doctors hospitals and pet stores  and no-kill shelters
this is what would be accessed when a person enters their zip to find one
when signed in you have the ability to access your pets records
When logged in the user could access their pets calander with options to book
appointments or delete them, but only if their vet is in the database

## Write between 3-5 user stories

As a pet-owner I want to get access to my pets medical charts
As a pet-owner I want to book my next appointment for my pet
As a pet-owner I want to know where the closest petstores are
As a pet-owner I want to be  reminded when my next appointment is
As a pet owner I want to update my pet's information
As a pet owner I want to cancel the appointment I cannot make

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?
Tables I will need will be for pet, vets, appointments

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

owners#signup
owners#signin
owners#signout
owners#changeInfo

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?
I think I will need a third party api for finding and retreiving the vet and pet
store names and location? Not exactly sure how to go about doing research on
the type of third party API there are.

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

I want to do the research on third party API on Monday so I have an idea of
what I am/or not doing. If that is not possible my site will be simpler which
is okay I want to decide on the caldnder plugin(jquery) that I will use and
implement that early, maybe on wednesday? Since it is something I have never
used before. Before that I want to build the rails api, and the database to
handle  vet appointments. I want to really break down the steps of the JS and
rails into smaller problems and pseudo code everything so that I have a really
good understanding of what I am doing.I will use bootstap again for auth events
but will do so last just building the skeleton of the UI/html/CSS. I will start
the steps for this hopefully by Friday, with the exception of the calander which
I will want pretty  early on to see how well everything interacts with it. I
need to do the sign in/sign-out/pet profile/ajax requests first. so doing that
and building the api which would handle those need to happen first. I want to be
done with these by thursday so I can move on to working on the database and sql
and the other JS actions like being able to book appointments through the
calander and sending out alerts which inform them to book appointments. Over the
weekend I want to be be able to jump back to the html and prune it up a bit. And
bug kill.
